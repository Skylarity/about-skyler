			Hi, I'm Skyler!
		</h1>
		<p>
			I've been coding in several different languages for three or four years. I've primarily used Game Maker: Studio and its aptly-named proprietary language Game Maker Language. I took two semesters of Java at UNM, and a semester of HTML, JavaScript, and SQL at CNM.
			<br>
			In my spare time I like to make music, art, and video games (and play them, too!). I have a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/skylarity" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a> where I post the latest songs I've been making.
			<br><br>
			<span class="center">I can't wait to get to know everyone and start working on projects!</span>
